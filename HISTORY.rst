0.2.2 (2023-05-11)
------------------
* Created submodule spark for allowing some models to be parallelize computations using spark

0.2.1 (2021-08-03)
------------------
* Added option for faster computation of average nearest neighbour properties by allowing for multiple links between the same nodes.
* Added compression option in to_networkx function.

0.2.0 (2021-07-12)
------------------
* Added likelihood and nearest neighbour properties.
* Revisited API for measures to ensure correct recompute if necessary.

0.1.3 (2021-04-29)
------------------
* Added new option for fitting the stripe model that ensures that the minimum non-zero expected degree is one
* Corrected issue in expected degree calculations

0.1.2 (2021-04-07)
------------------
* Added scale invariant probability functional to all models
