class GraphEnsemble():
    """ General class for graph ensembles.

    All ensembles can be defined in three ways:

    1) From a suitable Graph object: we can think this as a randomization of
    the observed graph. The conserved quantities and relevant vertex
    attributes are computed on the original graph to initialise the ensemble.
    It is then possible to fit the model parameters in order to get a
    probability distribution over all graphs from which to sample.

    2) From conserved quantities and relevant vertex attributes directly: in
    the case we do not have a reference graph but we do know what properties
    we want the ensemble to hold, we can directly use those properties to
    initialise the model. Once this step is completed we can similarly fit the
    parameters and sample from the ensemble.

    3) Fully specifying all model parameters: a final possibility is to
    initialise the model by giving it the list of parameters it needs in order
    to define the probability distribution over graphs. In this case we do not
    need to fit the model and the value of the conserved quantities over the
    ensemble will depend on the parameters passed to the model rather than
    vice versa.

    What these three possibilities entail will depend on the specifics of the
    model.

    Note that if keyword arguments are passed together with a Graph, then the
    arguments overwrite the graph property. This allows for easier definition
    of the ensemble for example when we want to modify one aspect of the
    reference graph but not all (e.g. only the density, but keeping strengths
    the same).
